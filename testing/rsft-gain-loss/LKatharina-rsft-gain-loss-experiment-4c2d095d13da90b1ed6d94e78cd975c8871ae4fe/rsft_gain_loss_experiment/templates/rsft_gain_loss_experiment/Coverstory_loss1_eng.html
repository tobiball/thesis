  You will choose between <b> two options 5 times</b>. The options <b>decrease your score</b>. You should <b>avoid</b> that your score <b>falls below the threshold</b>.
  The following graphics show two possible options in a round. Each option deducts <b>points with a probability</b>.
  You choose an <b> option by clicking on it</b>. Right after the choice you get feedback about how many points were deducted. No matter how often you choose an option, the probabilities stay the same during the round.
