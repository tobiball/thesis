  <p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
    You will choose between <b> two options 5 times</b> in order to <b>increase your score</b> and reach the <b>threshold</b>. The following graphics show two possible options in a round. Each option offers <b>points with a probability</b>.
    You choose an <b> option by clicking on it</b>. Right after the choice you get feedback about how many points you received.
    No matter how often you choose an option, the probabilities stay the same during the round.
