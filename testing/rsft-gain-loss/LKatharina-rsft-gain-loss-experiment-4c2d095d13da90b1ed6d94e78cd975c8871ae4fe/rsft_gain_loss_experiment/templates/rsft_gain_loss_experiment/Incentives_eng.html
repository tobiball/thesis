  After completition of the study you will receive {{ fee }}. In addition to this you can receive a bonus payment. The exact height of your bonus depends on your choices during the decision rounds.
  {% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <p> {% blocktrans with bonus=bonus_amount %}
  At the end of the study, four decision rounds will be drawn randomly out of all the subsequent rounds. These bonus rounds matter for your bonus. For each of the four bonus rounds you will receive additional {{bonus}}, if you reach the goal in this round. This mean your bonus can be between £0 to £1.00.

  <p> {% blocktrans%}
  <b>You only get the bonus for rounds, in which you reach the goal:</b><ul>
  <li>For "increasing points" rounds this means your score in the end of a round meets or exceeds the threshold.
  <li>For "decreasing points" rounds this means your score in the end of a round is equal or higher than the threshold.{% endblocktrans %}</ul></p>
