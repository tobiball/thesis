<p>
... and thank you for participating in this experiment.
    </p>
<p>
    The experiment will take about <b>9 minutes</b> of your time and is fully anonymous.
    It consists of multiple parts, including <b>instructions</b>, <b>questions</b> and a <b>game</b>.
    During the experiment you will also see <b>images</b> and <b>videos</b>.
</p>
<p>
In this game you will have to forage for food in a forest.
    The <b>amount of food</b> you gather determines your <b>Â£ reward</b>.
    There are dangerous animals in the woods.
    They may attack you during foraging, if you are not careful.
</p>
<p>
    The game itself will be very short and fast paced.
    For this short period you will need your full attention.
    Please try to remove any distractions now before you continue (e.g sounds).
